##1. Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home). Submit:

    * Figure or table with connection of push buttons on Nexys A7 board
| Button | Connection | ON | OFF |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| AN7 | U13 |AN7 | U13 |
| AN6 | K2 | AN7 | U13 |
| AN5 | T14 | AN7 | U13 |
| AN4 | P14 | AN7 | U13 |
| AN3 | J14 | AN7 | U13 |

    * Table with calculated values.

##2. Bidirectional counter. Submit:
    * Listing of VHDL code of the process `p_cnt_up_down` with syntax highlighting.
    * Listing of VHDL reset and stimulus processes from testbench file `tb_cnt_up_down.vhd` with syntax highlighting and asserts,
    * Screenshot with simulated time waveforms; always display all inputs and outputs,

##3. Top level. Submit:
    * Listing of VHDL code from source file `top.vhd` with all instantiations for the 4-bit bidirectional counter.
    * Image of the top layer including both counters, ie a 4-bit bidirectional counter from Part 4 and a 16-bit counter with a 10 ms time base from Part Experiments on your own. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand.
